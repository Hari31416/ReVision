# ReVision

This is a project where I'm trying to recreate all the ground breaking papers in computor vision using Tensorflow and Pytorch, and hence the name ReVision. The goal is to learn the concepts and the implementation details of the papers, and also to learn how to use Tensorflow and Pytorch. The papers and architectures which I'm planning to implement are listed below.

> Please have a look at the file `How_to_Use.md` for information on how to use this repository.

## Papers/Architectures

### LeNet

LeNet is a convolutional neural network which was proposed by Yann LeCun in 1998. It was the first convolutional neural network which was used to classify handwritten digits. The paper can be found [here](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-01a.pdf).
