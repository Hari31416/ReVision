# Inception

## Motivation

Most progress in field of image recognition and object detection is not just the result of more powerful hardware, larger datasets and bigger models, but mainly a consequence of new ideas, algorithms and improved network architectures.

> Our GoogLeNet submission to ILSVRC 2014 actually uses 12Ã— fewer parameters than the winning architecture of Krizhevsky et al (AlexNet) from two years ago, while being significantly more accurate. The biggest gains in object-detection have not come from the utilization of deep networks alone or bigger models, but from the synergy of deep architectures and classical computer vision.

In our case, the word 'deep' is used in two different meanings: first of all, in the sense that we introduce a new level of organization in the form of the 'Inception module' and also in the more direct sense of increased network depth.
